## Described ideas
Boat View - A toggleable scenario for the Ground Chest mod, where it will only display items located on a specific boat.

Land View - A toggleable scenario, similar to "Boat View", but only displaying items on land.

All View - A toggleable scenario, combining "Boat View" and "Land View" and also displaying items in water. Allows you to see all items nearby.

View types - These are "Boat View", "Land View", "All View".

Chest Memory - A workshop [mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2188383679) developed by sauktux, which shows what items are contained inside of a chest without the need of opening the chest. 

## Mod description
Ground Chest mod - A mod that "turns the ground into a chest". Open up a User Interface and see all items dropped nearby. Items in the User Interface can be clicked to be picked up and they are highlighted when hovered over. UI includes: As many nearby dropped items as possible; Sort button to sort by name, amount, fuel value, hunger, distance to player, in a chest(Explained later), etc.; button to switch between "Boat View", "Land View" or "All View"; button for compatibility mode with sauktux's mod "Chest Memory" to also see items contained inside chests, respecting the "View Types"(Items that are inside chests are marked with a small icon indicating such a scenario).
